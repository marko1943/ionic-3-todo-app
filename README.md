### Ionic To-Do app

Based on  Josh Morony's Build a Todo App from Scratch with Ionic 2 & 3

https://www.joshmorony.com/build-a-todo-app-from-scratch-with-ionic-2-video-tutorial/

This is updated version cause I couldn't find updated github repository for this ionic to-do crud app

The guide notes that the last update is July 6, 2017

### How to run

You can just clone the repo, cd into it and do the `npm install`

then a simple `ionic serve` will do
